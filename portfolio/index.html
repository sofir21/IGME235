It pokes fun at visual novel tropes, RIT culture  and gamer culture. The game was a week-and-a-half long personal project, created with the intention of experiencing one-person game development and to learn a new coding language. Since it was mostly a learning experience (and I worked on in the middle of a semester) it was left unfinished, but there is a working demo of the first part of the game.</p>

You play as a slime stuck in the sewers trying to escape.

I was born in Nicaragua, but have been living in Rochester since I started school three years ago. Before coming to RIT, I had never previously done any coding in my life, but in the past few years I have learned a lot thanks to classes and personal projects! I'm interested in working in a place where I feel challenged and have the potential to learn new things and put them in practice.
